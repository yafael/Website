	    <h2>Mixed Reality Chess Set</h2>
	    <h5>A product of Hack OHI/O 2016 - Ohio State University's Annual Hackathon</h5>
	    <p>Mixed Reality is the future. With the success of Pokemon Go, our team comprising of 
	       Danny Flax,Viral Patel and Ben Stammen and me created a virtual set where one can physically
	        interact with the virtual elements on the chessboard. A product created after 24 hours of intense
	        coding, project management and coffee addiction, our team secured <i>top position among over 750
	        students and 200+ teams</i>. For more information, visit my Github page.
	    </p>
	    <p>My contribution was taking the responsibility as a <i>Project Manager</i> for the team. Starting off 
	       with brainstorming ideas before the competition with team members, finalizing on an idea after 
 	       analyzing the pros and cons of each, preparing with installation of proper packages, IDE's on
	       everyone's machines. During the competition, my responsibility included designing hardware
	       component to interact with virtual objects, leading standup meetings, deciding strategy based on
 	       time limitation, keeping team members inspired and motivated, creating presentation for judges,
	       demonstrating project to judges as well as the audience.

	    <h2>Optical Character Recognition</h2>
	    <h5>Using Computer Vision Techniques to visualize handwriting</h5>
	    <p>As a part of Computer Vision for Human Computer Interaction class, our team made project to
	       recognize charcters from an image. The team comprised of Edrienne Co, Kyla Bouldin and myself.
	       We created a training data set that was trained with standardized fonts as well as different 
	       handwritings. We also created custom functions based on our requirements. We then had a testing
	       data set that was used to measure the accuracy of the program.	 
	    </p>
	    <p>My role was to design custom functions that sorted contours from left-right and top-bottom. I used
	       the concept of moment of contours along with tolerance level for achieving the designated goal. Another
	       task was to handle issues involving tittles (small dots on lowercase letters 'i' and 'j'). Our program
	       detected tittles to be separate characters and my role was to orevent that from happening.

	  <h2>Reform'N'ation - A Challenge to Lead India</h2>
	    <h5>Technology Alone cannot make a difference - A spoon of of kindness, a pinch of love and a cup 
	        of effort mixed together can create a sweet result</h5>
	    <p>Leader of 94-member team representing our University, we completed 99 tasks that focused on 18 of 
	       the most ignored social and ecological problems, such as Holistic Development of Child, Sustainability,
	       Human Rights and Healthful Living. After 3 months of hard-work, sleepless nights and sincere efforts, our
	       team managed to win the competition out of over 180 universities. Being awarded a special recognition by
	       CRY (Child Rights and YOU) for excellent leadership qualities was just the beginning.

	    <h2>Advanced Energy Vehicle</h2>
	    <h5>Even Dinosaurs need a ride</h5>
	    <p>This project involved a team of four students working to create a scaled transport AEV which focused on 
	       energy management, operational efficiency and operational consistency. The goal of the AEV was to successfully 
	       pick up the cargo that consisted of baby dinosaurs and deliver it to the desired destination avoiding all the 
	       obstacles. The track layout was pre-determined which is shown below.
	    </p>
	    <img src="files/track-layout.png"></br></br>
	    <p>Through intensive team work and time management, our team was able to create a successful AEV. The tasks were 
	       divided into four categories which involved building of the AEV, Data Recording, Data Analysing and Programming. 
	       I was the programmer and was responsible to effectively code the microcontroller for the project. Our team went 
	       a step further to create a video of the vehicle. The Critical Design Report which includes the programming 
               and energy analysis as well as the Video can be found below.

	    <h2>Scilab Textbook Companion Project</h2>
	    <h5>I can be an author too!</h5>
	    <p>Scilab Textbook Companion project is managed by the FOSSEE project, IIT Bombay. During the internship, 
	       I coded the book <i>‘Elements of Mechanical Engineering’ by N.M Bhatt and J.R Mehta</i>. Over 200 examples were 
	       successfully transferred in the Scilab language code. I was given a time frame of 3 months to complete the codes 
 	       but I managed to finish it in less than two months. The details about the internship can be found through the 
	       flowchart attached below. The book was officially published on June 13, 2014. The electronic copy can be found below.
