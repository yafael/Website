	    As far as back I can remember, my dad has always found my inquisitive nature to be inspiring. 
	    Frequently asking me why and how questions about subject with which I found a passionate curiosity 
	    positively affected my growth and development. After 22 years, even though I am half a globe away 
	    from home, I maintain constant communication with my father who continually pushes me to seek out and 
	    discuss the why’s and how’s of everyday life. Being an avid reader of ‘The Economist’ and having deep 
	    interest in the opportunities for digital change in our society, my strongest interests align within the 
	    field of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.

	    I am constantly envisioning the blend between technology, business, design and innovation. Programming is 
	    not my only strong suit. I am constantly looking for loopholes between product design, trying to make the  
	    product better. This has made me creative, changed my perspective about the things I use and has made me even
	    more thoughtful. Thinking one step ahead is the essence of a successful product designer. For example, five years
	    ago, when someone asked me, what is the use of a fan? I would immediately reply with - to provide cool air. 
	    Today, when you ask me the same question, I would reply,</br>
	    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
  	      <li><i>If you're sweating and talking about a ceiling fan, the use is to provide cool air</i></li>
              <li><i>If you're rich and talking about a ceiling fan, the use is to show off to people who visit your home</i></li>
  	      <li><i>If you're poor and talking about a table fan, the use might be to provide comfort to your child</i></li>
	      <li><i>If you're a student engineer, the use might be to use fan as a propeller for your vehicle</i></li>
	      <li><i>If you're an engineer working for Boeing, the use might be for proper functioning of an aircraft</i></li>
	      <li><i>If you're an owner of an amusement park, the use might be to provide cold air to people waiting in line</i></li>
	      and so on....
	    </ul>
	    This change is the greatest achievement of my life. Nothing has made me more happier than to be able to think
	    differently from others and in a unique way.

	    I have been taking online classes through edX since its launch. Learning is a continuous process and I am extremely
	    fortunate to have access to resources to further my knowledge in various domains. My ultimate goal in life is to create
	    a difference in the education sector in India. Promote creative and innovative learning environment to children. Develop
	    tools and means to not just educate children but also enhance teaching capabilities of teachers and reform the entire
	    learning experience.
