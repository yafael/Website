	    As far as back I can remember, my dad has always found my inquisitive nature to be inspiring. 
	    Frequently asking me why and how questions about subject with which I found a passionate curiosity 
	    positively affected my growth and development. After 23 years, even though I am half a globe away 
	    from home, I maintain constant communication with my father who continually pushes me to seek out and 
	    discuss the why’s and how’s of everyday life. Being an avid reader of ‘The Economist’ and having deep 
	    interest in the opportunities for digital change in our society, my strongest interests align within the 
	    field of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision with a focus on education for underprivileged.

	    I am constantly envisioning the blend between technology, business, design and innovation. More importantly
            blending these four areas with education. Having experience working with Maa Foundation during summer of 2015,
            I realized that there are millions of talented individuals who are deprived of opportunities. Working with children
            whose parents think that education does not matter was eye opener for me. My ultimate goal is to develop affordable and
            accessible education for these children and open up opprtunities for them to excel.</br>

	    I have been taking online classes through edX since its launch. Learning is a continuous process and I am extremely
	    fortunate to have access to resources to further my knowledge in various domains. My ultimate goal in life is to create
	    a difference in the education sector in India, promote creative and innovative learning environment to children. Develop
	    tools and means to not just educate children but also enhance teaching capabilities of teachers and reform the entire
	    learning experience.
	  </p>
	  <p>
  	    In 2015, I decided to further my knowledge in Business domain which started by taking HBX CORe classes by Harvard Business
	    School. It taught me the fundamentals of Business in areas of Business Analytics, Economics for Managers and Financial
	    Accounting. Later, I took Managing Your Career that taught me various opportunities and career paths for leaders. It was an
	    eye opener because it widened my horizons. Following up on that, I became a fan of disruption and innovation. What could be
	    better than taking Disruptive Strategy course from the legend Professor Clayton Christensen? Hence, in 2017, I registered for
	    the course and I have been a fan ever since.
